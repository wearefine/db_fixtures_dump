# db:fixtures:dump

Adds db:fixtures:dump rake task to dump all ActiveRecord tables into yaml fixtures

May not work for tables with serialized columns.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile (likely the only group you'd want this in would be development):

    gem 'db_fixtures_dump'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install db_fixtures_dump

## Usage

    $ rake db:fixtures:dump

### Output directory

Just like for the db:fixtures:load , you may specify FIXTURES_PATH to be used as the output directory.

    $ FIXTURES_PATH=db/backup rake db:fixtures:dump

### Excluding models

You can exclude models by specifying a list as EXCLUDE_MODELS.

	$ EXCLUDE_MODELS="MyLegacyModel AnotherOne" rake db:fixtures:dump

Or in combination with FIXTURES_PATH,

	$ EXCLUDE_MODELS="MyLegacyModel AnotherOne" FIXTURES_PATH=test/fixtures rake db:fixtures:dump
